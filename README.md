## 📝 Description
🐧 Penguin Species Profiler Project: Delved into the fascinating world of penguin species differentiation through an intensive analysis of their physical traits. Leveraging machine learning techniques, I explored five distinct models to classify penguins into their respective species. After rigorous evaluation, I implemented Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the optimal model, fine-tuning its parameters to achieve superior accuracy.

📊 Additionally, I visualized feature contributions, shedding light on the critical factors influencing species classification. Through meticulous examination, I unearthed the unique characteristics defining each species, providing valuable insights into penguin morphology and diversity.
